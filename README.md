# groupsummary
This is a test package which I created to try building a package.
I have added two functions to it.
1) groupby + summary across multiple variables which can be inputted as a string
2) create a boxplot with a factor variable on x axis

Run: ```devtools::install_github("mehtapriyesh/groupsummary")``` to use this Package.
